# Advance Network Technologies

This project contains GNS3 files with network topologies and configurations. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate different networking technologies using GNS3 software and a virtual Cisco 3725 router. This project was part of a course that I did in my 8th semester.

## Prerequisites

To use the files in this repository, you will need the following:

- [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) software installed on your machine. 
- A virtual [Cisco 3725](https://www.gns3.com/marketplace/appliances/cisco-3725) router image file.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open GNS3 and import the GNS3 project files from the cloned repository.
3. [Load](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/using-gns3/beginners/import-gns3-appliance/) the virtual Cisco 3725 router image file in GNS3.
4. Start the GNS3 project to test the network topologies and configurations.

## Contents

2. `OSPF_Single_Area.gns3project` - A GNS3 project demonstrating how to configure OSPF on a single area.
3. `OSPF_Multiple_Areas.gns3project` - A GNS3 project demonstrating how to configure OSPF on multiple areas.
4. `OSPF_Multiple_Autonomous_Systems.gns3project` - A GNS3 project demonstrating how to configure OSPF on multiple autonomous systems.
5. `BGP_with_Network_Statement.gns3project` - A GNS3 project demonstrating how to configure BGP with the use of network statement for advertising routes.
6. `BGP_with_IGP.gns3project` - A GNS3 project demonstrating how to configure BGP with the use of IGP for advertising routes.
7. `BGP_with_AS-PATH.gns3project` - A GNS3 project demonstrating how to configure BGP with the use of AS-PATH.
